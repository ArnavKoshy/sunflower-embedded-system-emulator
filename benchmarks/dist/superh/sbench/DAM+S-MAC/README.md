TX/RX/idle radio power in mW: 	89.1/33.0/0.0033
DAM Sample Rate:		1/100ms
Timer Delay:			1/4000
DAM min sensed strength:	10

The file ref.out is the "sunflower.out" output from an execution
with the above parameters.  Note that the simulation on each node
also leads to the creation of a simlog.node#, which in the case
of this benchmark, contains detection reports
